        <p>
          Based on the hit ride at Disneyland, <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i> is the story of how
          infamous smuggler and scoundrel Han Solo goes on one last mission for his dastardly
          employer Jabba the Hutt. He must retrieve and smuggle the Lost Ark back to
          Tatooine, but he must also change his entire outfit to avoid suspicion on this strange
          planet.

        <p>
          After the runaway success of the sequel to the hit Disneyland ride, George Lucas
          directed another film in the <i>Indiana Jones</i> saga. This time, Han Solo
          is tasked with completing a series of action sequences that do not advance the
          plot at all, but that Imagineers all agreed would make for a thrilling ride.

        <h3>The Last Crusade</h3>
        <p>
          After the Disneyland ride for <i>Temple of Doom</i> was closed down due to
          a terrible tragedy, George Lucas believed that a new film vaguely related to
          religious persecution while starring Han Solo would be the film that opened
          up the possibility of getting the greenlight for his dream project:
          <br>
          <em><i>Star Wars: THE RIDE</i></em>
          <br>
          (The tragedy was not related to the <i>Temple of Doom</i> ride, but it affected
          the nation so deeply that nobody could in good conscience continue enjoying
          what they once did.)
